# R.I.P. Itempool (2020 - 2024)

Itempool was a question banking system with special support for math and
live lectures. It launched in 2020 to support Grant Sanderson's "Lockdown Math"
series. Thousands of teachers and hundreds of thousands of students used
Itempool for one purpose or another.

In this repo are two directories:

1. /export — Contains a web server that serves a page allowing users to upload their zip file and export to Google docs.
2. /organize — Contains a script that massages raw Itempool content into zip files, one per user. This script is useless unless you already have access to the raw data, which you don't.
